# Focus verb: print, get, set, check

# I print text Hello World to the console
print("Hello World")

# I set a variable name with my name
name = "Fern Aerell"

# I print my name in variable like printed hello world before
print(name)

# You can get my name in variable name like this
name # but it is not displaying in console, why? because the expression not in print function.

# You must put the variable into function print argument, like this:
print(name)

# We have printed my name 2 times, you can see in console.

# We can put my name in another variable
name2 = name

# Now name2 is my name too, we check:
print(name2)

# If you feel this less clarity, you can add some string before argument name2 in print function, but don't forget about coma , for sparator
print("this is from name 2 variable:", name2)

# We check again, and see the different.

# Now we have printed my name  4 times.

# Let's do something different
# We add name to with name2 as print function argument
print(name + name2)
# Let see!

# I think on python we can do this:
print(name*10)
# Haha it's cool
# I found this feature just in python, i don't know about another language, but I first found this feature in python.

# Okay I thing this enough.
# Thank you.
